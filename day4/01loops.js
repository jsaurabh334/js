// In programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.
// three types of loops
// for loop
// while loop 
// do while loop


// program to display text 5 times
const n = 5;

// looping from i = 1 to 5
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    console.log(` this text is repeated ${n} times by saurabh`);
}



// program to display numbers from 1 to 5
const p = 5;

// looping from i = 1 to 5
// in each iteration, i is increased by 1
for (let i = 1; i <= p; i++) {
    console.log(i);     // printing the value of i
}
